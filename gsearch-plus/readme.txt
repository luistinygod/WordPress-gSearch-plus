== Description ==

Improves the WordPress search engine without messing with the database, sorts results by relevance, and more. Simple and clean!

WordPress' native search function doesn't return the best results in most cases. By default WordPress searches all terms through all the posts' titles & contents and orders the results by date. 

= Tired of complex plugins to improve the default WordPress search? =
gSearch Plus plugin improves WordPress' default mechanism by searching through custom taxonomies (including category and tags) and custom fields.  It orders the results by relevance, calculating the search words hits through the title and content of each post. 
This plugin also includes a stopwords mechanism to remove the non-relevant words from the query, thus increasing the relevance of the results. Stopwords can be defined manually (using the WP admin) or by using the default files provided with the plugin package.

= Features =
* Searches through all the posts, pages and custom post types, by title and content (AND query)
* Extends search to all custom taxonomies, category and tags (AND query)
* Extends search to custom fields (AND query)
* Sorts results by relevance
* Highlights searched terms (optional)
* Removes stopwords from search query
* Integrates the stopwords mechanism with Stella multi-language plugin, by removing the current language stopwords from the search query

Very easy to use and setup! No new database tables or complex configurations. gSearch Plus uses only WordPress' APIs and functions! Simple and Clean!



= Notes =
* Highlight search terms feature conflicts with `Jetpack by WordPress.com` plugin
* This release is not compatible with the new multisite feature of WordPress 3.0 yet. We're working on that!
* This release is compatible with all WordPress versions since 3.5. If you are still using an older one, upgrade your WordPress **NOW!**

= What do I need to know if I'm using Stella multi-language plugin? =
If you'd like to remove the correct language stopwords from your search query when using the Stella plugin, then go to **gSearch Plus** settings and change the *Remove Stopwords by language* to the option *Use stopwords files according to Stella languages*.
In order get this working properly you need to make sure there is a stopwords file per each configured language on your site. Check at the `/wp-content/plugins/gsearch-plus/stop` directory for the files. You'll find there are already several files pre-loaded with the gSearch Plus plugin (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Czech, German, Finnish, French, Polish, Dutch and more). You may edit those files to include/remove stopwords, or add new files. When adding new stopwords files name them as *stopwords-[LANGUAGE].php*, where LANGUAGE is a two letter code representing the Stella language (en -> English, de -> German, and so on).
